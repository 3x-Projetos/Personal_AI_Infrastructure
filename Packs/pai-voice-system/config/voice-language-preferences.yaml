# Voice Language Preferences
# Based on quality testing session 2026-01-15
#
# All voices are multilingual (PT-BR, EN, etc.) but have
# optimal quality in specific languages based on reference audio.

voices:
  jessica-voice:
    description: "Feminine, main assistant"
    optimal_language: "pt-BR"
    notes: "Sounds better in Portuguese. Primary voice for MAI."

  george-voice:
    description: "Masculine, mature"
    optimal_language: "en"
    notes: "Sounds better in English. Good for formal/technical content."

  brian-voice:
    description: "Masculine, young/dynamic"
    optimal_language: "en"
    notes: "Sounds better in English. Good for casual/energetic content."

  charlotte-voice:
    description: "Feminine, expressive"
    optimal_language: "en"
    notes: "Sounds better in English. Good for creative content."

# Recommended usage:
# - Portuguese content: jessica-voice (primary)
# - English content: george-voice, brian-voice, or charlotte-voice
# - Mixed content: jessica-voice (handles both adequately)

# Reference audio quality affects language performance.
# See issue #3 for improving voice references.
